# Unix

The unix shell provides a command-line interpreter. The shell provides an interface between the user and the kernel. The shell will pass your commands to the operating system. Mastering basic shell commands will help you speed up and automate a variety of tasks.

You can get started with unix by working through the exercises in [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/). Note: if you are working with CMS Open Data on a Windows computer, please do not install Git Bash in order to use a Unix terminal. Instead, install Ubuntu via Windows Subsystem Linux. This provides you with a Unix terminal that works well with the Open Data software, unlike Git Bash.

More advanced material is available in [Extra Unix Shell Material](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/shell-extras/).

A linux commmand line tutorial focused on ubuntu is available at [The Linux command line for beginners](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview).
